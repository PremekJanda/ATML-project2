# ATML-project2
The assignment aims to apply the techniques you have learned in class to investigate one of the datasets described below, build either a chatbot or question-answering system with it, and then make the system voice interactive, by connecting it to speech-to-text and text-to-speech models.

### Datasets
The options for the datasets for this task were 
  1. EDOS: Emotional Dialogues in Open Subtitles
  3. SQuAD2.0: The Stanford Question Answering Dataset

The tasks listed below are only suggestions. You donâ€™t need to perform exactly these tasks (for some
datasets they may not even be appropriate). 
Any ideas?

### 1. Investigate dataset:
Briefly describe the chosen dataset:
- First tutorial 
Play around with documents using some of the code from the course. You could, for example:
- First tutorial

### 2. Train and evaluate models:
Each of the datasets comes with a particular task that you can perform, so:
- Fourth tutorial is the goto here.

### 3. Add voice interactivity:
Use text-to-speech and speech-to-text models to add voice interaction to the best-performing chatbot / question-answering system found above.
- Fifth tutorial

### 4. Potential extensions:
- Any ideas?
